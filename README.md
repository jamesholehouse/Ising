# Ising
IsingModel module created to simulate the Ising model via Glauber or SSA, and produce ensemble simulations and statistics of Ising model processes in time. We have also implemented an exact solution for the mean field Ising model based on the method of [1]. For advice on package usage please refer to `How-to-Ising.ipynb` for the simulations and `How-to-Analytic-Ising.ipynb` for the analytic method.
